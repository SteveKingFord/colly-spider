Of the 55 patients, 43 were on conservative treatment and 12 were on dialysis. Serum laboratory parameters (creatinine, uric acid, C-reactive protein, total cholesterol and fractions, and triglycerides), nutritional status (z-score of body mass index, z-score of height/age), body fat (fat percentage and waist circumference), and blood pressure levels were evaluated. The carotid intima-media thickness measure was evaluated by a single ultrasonographer and compared with percentiles established according to gender and height. Data collection was performed between May 2015 and March 2016.","strong":"Materialandmethods:"},{"content":"Results:Of the children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease, 74.5% (95% CI: 61.0; 85.3) showed an increase (\u003eP95) in carotid intima-media thickness. In patients with stages I and II hypertension, 90.9% had increased carotid intima-media thickness. Nutritional status, body fat and laboratory tests were not associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness. After multivariate adjustment, only puberty (PR=1.30, p=0.037) and stages I and II arterial hypertension (PR=1.42, p=0.011) were independently associated with carotid intima-media thickness alterations.","strong":"Results:"},{"content":"Conclusion:The prevalence of increased carotid thickness was high in children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease. Puberty and arterial hypertension were independently associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness.","strong":"Conclusion:"}]}
